                            Joey becomes a learning extension teacher in soap acting. <br>
                            He gives his students very unconventional acting advice.<br>
                            When Joey hears one of his students is also auditioning for the same role he wants,<br>
                            he tries to sabotage him by giving him bad advice about how to play the character as a gay
                            man.<br>
                            This backfires on Joey, as the other actor is appreciated for <br> his gay acting and
                            selected for the part along with a two-year TV contract.

                            Wedding," <br>
                            where he explains to the sister of a patient that he's treating her for a subcranial
                            hematoma.<br>
                            He then asks the sister out for coffee.

                        <p>
                            Joey's new agent manages to obtain him a role in the new Al Pacino movie.<br>
                            However, the role is Pacino's butt double in a shower scene.<br>
                            Despite this, Joey manages to ruin it by overacting his role, which later gets him
                            fired.<br>
                            The friends console him and reassure him that his big break is coming.
